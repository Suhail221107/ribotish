2017-7-28 ribotish 0.1.8

	Many updates.

	Add TIS initiation efficiency comparison in tisdiff.

	For replicate data, tisdiff still cannot deal with replicate samples, but can now export count table for replicate samples.

	Add '--chrmap' option to match different chr name versions between fasta, bam and gene annotation files. Simple conversions such as 'chr1' to '1' will be matched automatically without using this option.

	Quality can print total effective RPF counts that were assigned offset values in annotated CDS regions under -v option.

2017-4-20 ribotish 0.1.7

	Fix error in quality using one CPU.

	Fix pth error in tisdiff.

2017-3-22 ribotish 0.1.6

	Add --inprofile option in predict. Ribotish can load transcript RPF profile from txt file generated from --transprofile option instead of bam files.

	Add --seq and --aaseq options to report ORF and peptide sequences.

	Change -a option, mainly for protein coding annotation if annotation for prediction mainly focus on non-coding RNAs.

	Move zbio library into ribotish folder.
